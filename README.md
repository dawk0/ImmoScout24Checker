# ImmoScout24Checker
 
This script will periodically parse a Immobilienscout24 search URL and will tell you if new exposes show up through a Telegram bot message.

To get the Telegram bot to work the script will look into another file which you'll need to create: credentials.py (or just provide the following variables directly in the script):
```
bot_token = '1234567890:AABBCCDDEEFFGGHHIIJJKKLLMMNNOOPPQQR'
bot_chatID = '123456789'
```
